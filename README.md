# recipe_analysis
Analyzed a collection of recipes using Naive Bayes, performed a sentiment analysis on corresponding reviews and used Guardian API to pull recipe article headlines


Objective:

Identify a topic of interest to you (personal or professional)
Identify a set of questions related to your topic of interest
Find external data (e.g. from kaggle) to process, analyze using any ML methodologies, visualize it and answer the questions from the previous point.
Use a news API to extract related articles using keywords from your topic of interest to create word frequencies, word clouds, any other creative visualizations or sentiment analysis if appropriate.
Conduct sentiment analysis using any resource (e.g your external data or twitter or news api).
Formulate a short 500 word summary that summarizes and concludes this short project.

My primary questions to be answered are as follows:
•	Can the popularity of a recipe be predicted by its ingredients?
•	What factors (other than quality of the recipe) might influence the sentiment of a review?
•	What type of recipes/ingredients are popular throughout the different seasons of the year?

To accomplish this task, I used the Kaggle dataset from Food.com which contains data on 10,000 recipes with 234,115 corresponding reviews, including scoring and review text. Additionally, I used the Guardian News API to extract recipe headlines throughout the 2020 year. I used Jupyter Notebook for my analysis with several libraries and packages.
